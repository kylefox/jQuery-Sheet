This started as a library for creating slide-down modal boxes for jQuery ([example](http://dribbble.com/shots/20506-Dropdown-Sheet)) but has fallen out of use and is no longer maintained.

Feel free to try it and see if you can get it working properly. If you do, send me a pull request and I'd be happy to merge it in.
